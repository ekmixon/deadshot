# This is the celery worker that processes each webhook payload after the blueprint verifies it's from a valid
# sender. The worker handles Pull Requests based on action mentioned in the payload (webhook_json). If it receives
# a open, reopen, or synchronize action it proceeds to search for tokens by passing it along to the pr_scanner
# function. If it receives a closed action then it scans for secrets and creates a JIRA ticket in the Security
# team's queue so they can reach out to the engineers.
